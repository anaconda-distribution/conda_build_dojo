# IMPORTANT: If your lesson requires a snapshot of a channel(s) in a certain 
# state (e.g. missing some dependencies for python-3.9), then please make
# sure to add the URLs for the necessary packages in a `dojo_channels_pkgs.txt`
# file under the lesson directory. (See README for more details.) For example:
#
# dojo/
#   |---- lessons/
#           |---- 001_version_bump/
#                   |---- dojo_channels_pkgs.txt
#                   |---- lesson.yaml

  - Build an updated version of tqdm (from 4.55.2 to 4.56.0).

# Tags.
# Learners can search for this lesson using tags entered here.
tags: ['version', 'version bump', 'update', 'update versions', 'tqdm']

# Package name and version the learner will be attempting to build.
target_package: tqdm-4.56.0

# Target platform the package will be built for.

# URL to the feedstock (use HTTPS, not SSH, to avoid the need for a key).
feedstock_url: https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/tqdm-feedstock.git

# The specific commit hash from the feedstock repo that should be initially 
# checked out. This acts as the starting point for the learner, a "snapshot"
# in time from which they will complete their lesson objectives.

# BONUS: Provide hints to the learner (just tell them the hint will be 
# revealed in the next step if they want it).
