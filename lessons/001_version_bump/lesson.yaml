# IMPORTANT: If your lesson requires a snapshot of repodata in a certain 
# state (e.g. missing some dependencies for python-3.9), then please make
# sure the repodata is saved in the following directory structure:
#
# dojo/
#   |---- lessons/
#           |---- 001_version_bump/
#                   |---- dojo_repodata/
#                           |---- <TIMESTAMP>/
#                                   |---- linux-64/
#                                           |---- repodata.json
#                                   |---- noarch/

# The lesson title.
title: "How to do a version bump"

# Learning objectives. 
# Each objective should help complete this sentence: 
# "By the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to..."
objectives: 
  - Build an updated version of tqdm.
  # - Run the upload script on Zeus.
  # - Here's another objective.
  # - And another objective.
  # - Finally the last objective.

# Tags.
# Learners can search for this lesson using tags entered here.
tags: ['version', 'version bump', 'update', 'update versions', 'tqdm', 'upload to Zeus']

# Package name and version the learner will be attempting to build.
target_package: tqdm-4.56.0

# Target platform the package will be built for.
target_platform: noarch

# URL to the feedstock (use HTTPS, not SSH, to avoid the need for a key).

# The specific commit hash from the feedstock repo that should be initially 
# checked out. This acts as the starting point for the learner, a "snapshot"
# in time from which they will complete their lesson objectives.

# Indicates whether this lesson requires a modified repodata "snapshot".
# In other words, a version of defaults that's been edited to recreate the 
# starting point for the lesson.

# Lesson prompts (or steps).
# List the propmpts/steps the learner should go through.
# You can also pose questions and answers (for example, one prompt is 
# a question, and the subsequent prompt is the answer to that question).
# BONUS: Provide hints to the learner (just tell them the hint will be 
# revealed in the next step if they want it).
prompts:
  - Open the meta.yaml and find the current version and sha256 hash.
  - Go to https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/4.58.0/#files and get the latest version number and sha256 hash.
