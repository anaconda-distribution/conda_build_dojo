# PLEASE ADD VALUES FOR ALL KEYS BELOW.

# IMPORTANT: If your lesson requires a snapshot of repodata in a certain 
# state (e.g. missing some dependencies for python-3.9), then please make
# sure the repodata is saved in the following directory structure:
#
# dojo/
#   |---- lessons/
#           |---- 0001_version_bump/
#                   |---- dojo_repodata/
#                           |---- linux-64/
#                                   |---- repodata.json
#                           |---- noarch/
#                                   |---- repodata.json

# The lesson title.
# Example: "How to do a version bump"
title: 

# Learning objectives. 
# Each objective should help complete this sentence: 
# "By the end of this lesson, the learner will be able to..."
objectives: 
  - "EXAMPLE OBJECTIVE"

# Package name and version the learner will be attempting to build.
# Example: numpy-1.16.0
target_package:

# Target platform the package will be built for.
# Examples: linux-64, osx-64, win-64, noarch
target_platform: 

# URL to the feedstock (use HTTPS, not SSH, to avoid the need for a key).
# Example: https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/tqdm-feedstock.git
feedstock_url: 

# The specific commit hash from the feedstock repo that should be initially 
# checked out. This acts as the starting point for the learner, a "snapshot"
# in time from which they will complete their lesson objectives.
commit: 

# Indicates whether this lesson requires a modified repodata "snapshot".
# In other words, a version of defaults that's been edited to recreate the 
# starting point for the lesson. 
# If your lesson requires the repodata snapshot, update this to be "True".
modified_repodata: False

# Lesson prompts (or steps).
# List the propmpts/steps the learner should go through.
# You can also pose questions and answers (for example, one prompt is 
# a question, and the subsequent prompt is the answer to that question).
# BONUS: Provide hints to the learner (just tell them the hint will be 
# revealed in the next step if they want it).
prompts:
  - EXAMPLE - Open the meta.yaml...
  - EXAMPLE - Increment the build number...
